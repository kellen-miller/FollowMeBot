# ArduinoRobot

Code for an robot built with an Arduino board that would sense heat (humans) and follow them.

This was an final project for an elective class my senior year. Having no prior experience in robotics or the Arduino
language/board,
I thought it would be cool to try and create something that interacted with people.
